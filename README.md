# Speak App

Speak is an Augmentative and Alternative Communication(AAC) application for non-verbal individuals.
Check out the site [here](http://dbc-speak.herokuapp.com/)!

## Description:

We created a free alternative to the sometimes prohibitively expensive Augmentative and Alternative Communication devices that allow nonverbal individuals to express themselves. This non-traditional web app relies on Amazon Polly (a text-to-speech service), click event handling, UX design, and user customizability.

## Tech:

- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
- Javascript / jQuery
- AJAX
- Bootstrap
- AWS Polly and Cloudinary
